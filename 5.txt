In previous section we have reached AWS CodeBuild where it fetches the code and sends
it to the SonarCloud for quality check And it alsp Download dependencies from the codeArtifact

NExt Stage: Now next step is to build the Artifact and store it on S3 bucket

## AWS Codebuild for Build Artifact ##

For this section we have another builspec file which lies in AWS-files
so we are going to make some changes in that buildspec file

STeps:
DO the same like we do previous copy command of "Export from maven on codeArtifact"
and place it in the buildspec file
Now commit the changes
Come to codebuild and create a new project
keep the things same like before and add the path of buildpsec file
"aws-files/build_buildspec.yml"


add the same group name like we did before 
Now got to IAM role
Search for the role which we have created while creating code build project
then and add policy of "COdeArtifactReadOnlyAccess"

Now RUN start Build and check if it is successful

## Setting up codepipelines to connect all the services together ##

Creating S3 bucket: Firstly we are going to create a S3 bucket to store our Artifact
Now create a folder inside bukcet where we will store the Artifact

Creating SNS: for recieving notificatiosn regarding the evens happening in codebuild and other
Create a topic, now create subscription for the topic
In protcol select email
Now confrim it through gmail which you have provided


Creating Codepipeline servicie:
Steps:
Gave a name to pipeline and to service role
Select bitbucket as source provider so when there is a commit it triggers the pipeline
select the repo
select the branch
now select the build provider as CodeBuild select project fisrlty cretaed build after creating codepipeline 
we will add other project as well
Skip the test and build stage we will add it later in edit section
now slect create pipleine and stop execution bcz we are going 
to add stages
Now in Edit section we will add CodeAnalysis stage where we 
will select everython about Analysis 
select project name as Analysis
After build stage we will create a Deploy stage
Select Action provider as S3
Select input Artifact as BuildArtifact
Select S3 buket and folder name as created folder

-- Setting the Notifications --
Go to the settings section of the codepipeline
click on the notification 
starets create notification
Select SNS topic which we have created
And Submit


We have all set here now have to come to pipeline to relase the changes 


## Now wehn their is a change it will trigger code pipeline and starts building and testing the code ##

## Test the Pipeline ##
lets add a extra # in the Readme.md file and commit the changes
