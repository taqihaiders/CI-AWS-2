Scenario: We have developer team who are working on agile SDLC
which means they are required to change nad test the code frequesntly 
if the error comes out then they are required to trace error initially

Soltution: Continous Integration
BCz CI makes sure the at every commit code will be tested

We are doing CI on CLOUD

Services we are using: 
Bitbucket: for code repo
code artifact: for maven dependencies
AWs CODe build: to build code
Sonar cloud : for code analysis
code build : to build artifact
S3 : for storage
SNS : for notification
AWS code pipeline : for connecting all the services together


FLow of working :
FIrstly the developer push the code into bitbucket repository which we will setup
at every commit AWS codepipeline trigger and sonarcloud will start doing analysis and run tests
We also required Maven dependencies for building the code so we use code artifact for storing maven dependencies
If the quality of the source code is good then it will go to next step to build the artifact for this we are going to use AWS buildjob to execute "mvn build"
which will generate the artifact and the stire the output into the S3 bucket.


Steps:
1 Bitbucket creation
- cretae account and repo on BB
- ssh autehntication from local to BB account
- migrate vprofile project soucre code from hithub to bitbucket
2 Code Artifact
- create code artifact repo
- look at the setting for pom.xml and settings.xml
- understand the buildpsec.yml file for code andlysis build job
3 Sonar cloud 
- cretae account and set project details
4 Parameter store
- store sonar cloud dteials into PS
- mention parameter store details in builspec.yml file
5 AWS code build job
- Understand buildspec.yml file for code build job
- Update pom.xml & settings.xml for code artifact repo detail
- create a build job for sonar code analysis

6 build job ofr Artifact
- understand buildspec.yml file
- Cretae S3 bucket for artifcat storage
- create aws code build job
- Execute and test
7 Code pipeline
- Create SNS notifications 
- cretae aws codepipeline
- Execute and test
